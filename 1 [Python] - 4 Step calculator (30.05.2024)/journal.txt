## Software for this Python project:

I used PyCharm software from the JetBrain suite. It had been recommended to me and I had already used it!
From what I've been told, it performs better than Visual Studio Code when it comes to Thread management, but I'm not sure I have enough knowledge to justify using it. I use it because it was recommended to me!

--------------------------------------------------

## Libraries used:

I use the “math” module which, I believe, is included with python to perform logical operations.

For aesthetics, there's “tkinter” included as standard, but I found a site talking about “customtkinter” which works in a similar way, with better aesthetics.

Installation: [ pip install customtkinter ]
(To install it via this command, on windows with powershell, I think you need to have selected “install in PATH” when installing python!)
